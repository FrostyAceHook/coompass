Coompass
========

i lied actually; this is 2oompass, the sequel to the critically-acclaimed coompass.

Fabric mod for minecraft 1.8.9 which displays the coordinates and direction of
the player on the screen. Configurable via an options file which is created in
the mod folder (yes i know spectacular design). The config file can be deleted at
any time and it will be recreated with the defaults.

For your convenience, the latest build is [here](2oompass-1.4.jar). It doesn't
depend on the fabric api, and you can be build the source via `gradlew build`
(mod jar will be at `build/libs/2oompass-*.jar`).
