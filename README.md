Coompass
========

i lied actually; this is 2oompass, the sequel to the critically-acclaimed coompass.

Fabric mod for minecraft 1.8.9 which displays the coordinates of the player on
the screen. Configurable via an options file which is created in the mod folder
(yes i know spectacular design). The config file can be deleted at any time and
it will be recreated with the defaults.

i don't really remember how this mod works, let alone how to build it so theres
no gitignore, and im gonna assume that [1.3](2oompass1.3-mc1.8.9.jar) is the best
version so download that one ig. i also dont remember if you need the fabric api but i think you dont so :)
